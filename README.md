# Maze Solver

This project implements a maze solver using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm.

## Features

*   **Maze Generation:** Generates random mazes of varying sizes.
*   **Maze Solving:** Solves mazes using DFS.
*   **Visualization:** Provides a visual representation of the maze and the solution path.

## Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JacobA12/maze_solver.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd maze_solver
    ```
3.  **Run the solver:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Dependencies

*   Python 3.x
*   pygame

## Algorithm

The maze solver utilizes a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find a path from the start to the end of the maze.
